<br><br>


## Question 2
The `series_housing_price` DataFrame contains FRED series `id`s for the Home Price Index across 16 metropolitan statistical areas, each categorized into three price tiers: low, middle, and high.

```{.python}
url = 'https://bcdanl.github.io/data/fred_api_series_housing_price.csv'
series_housing_price = pd.read_csv(url)
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true
#| warning: false
#| message: false

df <- read_csv('https://bcdanl.github.io/data/fred_api_series_housing_price.csv')
DT::datatable(df)
```

<br>

For more information regarding the index, please visit [Standard & Poor's](https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/es/documents/methodologies/methodology-sp-cotality-cs-home-price-indices.pdf). There is more information about home price sales pairs in the Methodology section. Copyright, 2025, Standard & Poor's Financial Services LLC. 


Provide a Python code (**excluding your FRED API key**) to construct the following DataFrame:

<!-- ```{.python} -->
<!-- url = 'https://bcdanl.github.io/data/home_price_index_2025_01_01.csv' -->
<!-- home_price = pd.read_csv(url) -->
<!-- ``` -->

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true
#| warning: false
#| message: false

df <- read_csv('https://bcdanl.github.io/data/home_price_index_2025_01_01.csv')
DT::datatable(df)
```

<br>

-	Note that the `id` variable in the `series_housing_price` DataFrame corresponds to the `series_id` key used in the parameter dictionary (`param_dicts`) used for making requests to the FRED API.
	
- To iterate over the `id` values in the  `series_housing_price` DataFrame, you can convert the variable to a list using `.tolist()`:

```{.python}
for val in series_housing_price['id'].tolist():
   # do something with val
```


- Below replaces 'Home Price Index (' with '' (empty string) in the `title` column:

```{.python}
df_all['title'] = df_all['title'].str.replace('Home Price Index (', '')
```


- The `title` column can split into the `tier` and `city` variables using the following code:

```{.python}
# Split the 'title' column into two new variables, 'ranking' and 'title'
# by the first occurrence of " Tier) for ". 

# expand=True tells pandas to return the results in a DataFrame
  # If expand were False, the result would be a Series of lists.

# Use \) to escape the closing parenthesis, which has special meaning in regex
df_all[['tier', 'city']] = df_all['title'].str.split(' Tier\) for ', expand=True)  
```


- The DataFrame is sorted first by `state`, then by `city` within each `state`, then by `date` in descending order within each `city`, and finally by `tier` within each `city`-`date` group.
  - To sort observations in a custom order (like Low, Middle, High), you can convert the `tier` variable to a categorical variable with an explicit order, and then sort.

```{.python}
df = pd.DataFrame({
    'tier': ['Middle', 'High', 'Low', 'Middle', 'Low'],
    'city': ['NY', 'LA', 'CHI', 'SF', 'SEA']
})

tier_order = ['Low', 'Middle', 'High']
df['tier'] = pd.Categorical(df['tier'], categories=tier_order, ordered=True)

df_sorted = df.sort_values('tier')
```

# Part 2. Pandas Basics

```{.python}
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
```



The following describes the context of DataFrame in Part 2.

[Open Payments](https://openpaymentsdata.cms.gov), which is managed by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), is a national disclosure program created by the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The program promotes transparency and accountability by helping consumers understand the financial relationships between pharmaceutical and medical device industries, physicians, and non-physician practitioners (NPP). Non-physician practitioners (NPPs) collectively refers to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists/anesthesiologists and certified nurse-midwives provider types. 

These financial relationships may include consulting fees, research grants, travel reimbursements, and payments made from the industry to medical practitioners. It is important to note that financial ties between the health care industry and health care providers do not necessarily indicate an improper relationship.

- Let us consider the CMS' Open Payments data for selected cities in **New York state** in **year 2022**, the `cms_ny_2022` DataFrame:

```{.python}
cms_ny_2022 = pd.read_csv('https://bcdanl.github.io/data/cms-2022-cities-all.zip')
```

rmarkdown::paged_table(cms_ny_2022)
```

<br>

## Question 3
- Write a Python code to convert the **string** type `Physician_or_NPP` variable into the **category** type variable.



<br>

## Question 4
- Write a Python code to replace the **NaN** value of the `Specialty_Detail` variable with the value of the `Specialty` variable.
  - For example, the following shows that
    - All **NaN** values in the `Specialty_Detail` variable, where the `Specialty` is **Physician Assistant**, are replaced with **Physician Assistant**.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true
#| warning: false
#| message: false
cms_ny_2022 <- cms_ny_2022 |> 
  mutate(Specialty_Detail = ifelse(is.na(Specialty_Detail), Specialty, Specialty_Detail))

df <- cms_ny_2022 |> 
  mutate(Specialty_Detail = ifelse(is.na(Specialty_Detail), Specialty, Specialty_Detail)) |> 
  select(Specialty, Specialty_Detail) |> 
  filter(Specialty == Specialty_Detail, Specialty == "Physician Assistant")

rmarkdown::paged_table(df)
```


<br>

## Question 5
Write a Python code to count the number of transactions in which the payment amount (i.e., `Amount_of_Payment`) falls in the top 10% of all payments in the DataFrame. 



<br>



## Question 6

<br>


## Question 7
- Write a Python code to count the number of occurrences of each unique value in `Specialty_Detail` for each unique value in `Taxonomy`.
  - For example, the following displays the number of occurrences of each unique value in `Specialty_Detail` for the **Dental Providers** `Taxonomy` value.


```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true
#| warning: false
#| message: false
df <- cms_ny_2022 |>

  group_by(Specialty_Detail) |> 
  count()

rmarkdown::paged_table(df)
```




<br>



## Question 8
- Write a Python code to count the number of unique `Specialty_Detail` values for the value **"Dental Providers"** in `Taxonomy`.


```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true
#| warning: false
#| message: false
df <- cms_ny_2022 |> 
  filter(Taxonomy == "Dental Providers") |> 
  group_by(Taxonomy) |> 
  summarise(n_unique = n_distinct(Specialty_Detail))

rmarkdown::paged_table(df)

```




<br>


## Question 9
- Write a Python code (1) to count the number of missing values and (2) to calculate mean, standard deviation, minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile, and maximum of the `Amount_of_Payment` variable for the value **Dermatology** in the `Specialty` variable.



<br>


## Question 10
- Write a Python code to replicate the following DataFrame, which calculates (1) the number of physicians in each city, (2) the number of NPPs in each city, (3) the number of physicians and NPPs in each city, and (4) the percentage of physicians and NPPs in each city, as shown below.
  - Ensure that the sum of the percentages of physicians and NPPs within each city is 100.
  - Ensure that the observations are sorted by `Total_Count` and `City` in descending and ascending orders, respectively.



```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true
#| warning: false
#| message: false
df <- cms_ny_2022 |> 
  select(City, Physician_or_NPP, NPI) |> 
  distinct() |> 
  group_by(City, Physician_or_NPP) |> 
  summarise(count = n()) |> 
  mutate(Total_Count = sum(count),
            Percent = round(100 * count / Total_Count, 2)) |> 
  arrange(-Total_Count, City)

rmarkdown::paged_table(df, options = list(rows.print = nrow(df)))

```

<br>


## Question 11
- Write a Python code to calculate:
  - The total `Amount_of_Payment` the `Product_Manufacturer` **AbbVie Inc.** paid to physicians and non-physician practitioners (NPPs) in `Cities` of **Rochester**, **Buffalo**, and **Syracuse**.
  - How many times the `Product_Manufacturer` **AbbVie Inc.** paid to physicians and non-physician practitioners (NPPs) in  in `Cities` of **Rochester**, **Buffalo**, and **Syracuse**.



```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true
#| warning: false
#| message: false
df_producer_city <- cms_ny_2022 |> 
  filter(City %in% c('Rochester', 'Buffalo', 'Syracuse'),
         Product_Manufacturer == "AbbVie Inc.") |> 
  group_by(Product_Manufacturer) |> 
  summarise(Total_Amount_of_Payment = round(sum(Amount_of_Payment, na.rm = T), 2),
            count = n())

rmarkdown::paged_table(df_producer_city)
```


<br>


## Question 12
- Consider the following two DataFrames, `cms_ny_2022_npi` and `cms_ny_2022_records`:

```{.python}
cms_ny_2022_npi = pd.read_csv('https://bcdanl.github.io/data/cms-2022-cities-npi.csv')
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true
#| warning: false
#| message: false

cms_ny_2022_npi <- read_csv('https://bcdanl.github.io/data/cms-2022-cities-npi.csv')
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true
#| warning: false
#| message: false

rmarkdown::paged_table(cms_ny_2022_npi)

```
-	`cms_ny_2022_npi`: This DataFrame is created from `cms_ny_2022` by selecting only the columns `NPI`, `Physician_or_NPP`, `First_Name`, `Last_Name`, `City`, `Type`, `Taxonomy`, `Specialty`, and `Specialty_Detail.` 
  - In addition, it contains only unique observations (i.e., there are no duplicate rows).



```{.python}
cms_ny_2022_records = pd.read_csv('https://bcdanl.github.io/data/cms-2022-cities-records.csv')
```


```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true
#| warning: false
#| message: false

cms_ny_2022_records <- read_csv('https://bcdanl.github.io/data/cms-2022-cities-records.csv')
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true
#| warning: false
#| message: false

rmarkdown::paged_table(cms_ny_2022_records)

```

-	`cms_ny_2022_records`: This DataFrame is derived from `cms_ny_2022` by including every observation but only retaining the columns `Record_ID`, `Month`, `Day`, `Amount_of_Payment`, `Product`, `Product_Manufacturer`, and `NPI`.


- Write a Python code to create the `cms_ny_2022` DataFrame by using the `cms_ny_2022_npi` and `cms_ny_2022_records` DataFrames. 



<br>

## Question 13
- Write a Python code to create the following DataFrame, `City_Physician_or_NPP`, which counts the number of physicians and the non-physician practitioners (NPPs) in each city.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true
#| warning: false
#| message: false

City_Physician_or_NPP <- cms_ny_2022 |>
  distinct(City, Physician_or_NPP, NPI) |> 
  count(City, Physician_or_NPP) |>    
  pivot_wider(names_from = Physician_or_NPP, values_from = n)


rmarkdown::paged_table(City_Physician_or_NPP, options = list(rows.print = nrow(City_Physician_or_NPP)))
```
