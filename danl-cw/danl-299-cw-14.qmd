The dataset ,`beer_markets.csv`, (with its pathname `https://bcdanl.github.io/data/beer_markets.csv`) includes information about beer purchases across different markets, brands, and households.


```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
#| code-fold: false

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
beer = pd.read_csv('https://bcdanl.github.io/data/beer_markets.csv')
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true
#| results: asis

DT::datatable(readr::read_csv('https://bcdanl.github.io/data/beer_markets.csv'))
```

- Each observation in `beer` is a household-level transaction record for a purchase of beer.

## Variable Description

- `hh`: an identifier of the household;
- `X_purchase_desc`: details on the purchased item;
- `quantity`: the number of items purchased;
- `brand`: Bud Light, Busch Light, Coors Light, Miller Lite, or Natural Light;
- `dollar_spent`: total dollar value of purchase;
- `beer_floz`: total volume of beer, in fluid ounces;
- `price_per_floz`: price per fl.oz. (i.e., beer spent/beer floz);
- `container`: the type of container;
- `promo`: Whether the item was promoted (coupon or otherwise);
- `market`: Scan-track market (or state if rural);
- demographic data, including gender, marital status, household income, class of work, race, education, age, the size of household, and whether or not the household has a microwave or a dishwasher.

<br>

## Question 1
What are the descriptive statistics (mean, count, min, max) for `dollar_spent` and `beer_floz` grouped by `brand`?

*Answer:*

<br><br>

## Question 2
- For each `market`, find the average `price_per_floz`, total `dollar_spent`, and total `beer_floz`. 
- Which `market` has the highest average `price_per_floz`?


<br><br>

## Question 3 
- Compute the share of `dollar_spent` on each `brand` as a percentage of the total spending by each household.
	-	In the resulting DataFrame, retain only the following three variables:
    	1.	`hh` (household ID)
    	2.	`brand`
    	3. total dollars spent by the household
    	4.	The calculated** percentage contribution** of spending on that brand
	-	Ensure the resulting DataFrame contains only one row per household–brand pair.


*Answer:*


<br><br>

## Question 4 
- Identify the `brand` with the highest `price_per_floz` in each `market` using a custom function with `apply()`. 

*Answer:*


<br><br>


## Question 5 
- Among households that have purchased BUD LIGHT at least once, what proportion only bought BUD LIGHT?
- Among households that have purchased BUSCH LIGHT at least once, what proportion only bought BUSCH LIGHT?
- Among households that have purchased COORS LIGHT at least once, what proportion only bought COORS LIGHT?
- Among households that have purchased MILLER LITE at least once, what proportion only bought MILLER LITE?
- Among households that have purchased NATURAL LIGHT at least once, what proportion only bought NATURAL LIGHT?
- Which of these beer brands has the highest share of loyal customers, who purchase no other brand?

- For example, let's consider the following example DataFrame with the four households:
```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true
#| results: asis
DT::datatable(data.frame(hh = c(1,1,1,1,
                                         2,2,2,2,
                                         3,3,3,
                                         4,4),
                                  brand = c(rep('BUD',4),
                                            'COORS', 'BUD','MILLER', 'NATURAL',
                                            'BUD', 'BUD', 'BUD',
                                            'COORS', 'BUSCH')),
                       options = list(rows.print = 15)
                       )
```

In this example, households `1`, `2` and `3` purchased `BUD` at least once, and only the households `1` and `3` purchased `BUD` only. Therefore, among households that have purchased BUD LIGHT at least once, the proportion only bought `BUD` is 2/3 = 66.67%.
