The `netflix.csv` file (with its pathname `https://bcdanl.github.io/data/netflix.csv`) contains a list of 6,000 titles that were available to watch in November 2019 on the video streaming service Netflix. It includes four variables: the video’s `title`, `director`, the date Netflix added it (`date_added`), and its `type` (category).
