Below is to set up the web scrapping environment with Python `selenium`:

```{.python}
import pandas as pd
import os
import time
import random
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.chrome.options import Options

wd_path = 'PATHNAME_FOR_YOUR_DATA_DIRECTORY'   # 'YOUR_DATA_DIRECTORY'
os.chdir(wd_path)
```

# Question 1

- Use Python Selenium to scrap the table in the following webpage as a `pandas`' `DataFrame`:
  - [https://www.eia.gov/petroleum/gasdiesel/gaspump_hist.php](https://www.eia.gov/petroleum/gasdiesel/gaspump_hist.php)
  
- Export the `DataFrame` as a CSV file.

- Tip: Consider using loop over a XPath f-string:

```{.python}
for i in range(1, 10):
    xpath = f'/html/body/div[1]/div[2]/div/div[4]/div/div[1]/div/table/tbody/tr[{i}]/td[1]'
    print(xpath)
```


*Answer*:
```{python}

```

# Question 2

- Provide your Python Selenium code to scrape all the quotes in [this website](http://quotes.toscrape.com).

  - You should create the two DataFrames with the following variables:
  
  1. DataFrame about each quote with the following variables:
    - `quote`
    - `author`
    - `tags`
    - `about`, URL for description about each author.
  2. DataFrame about each author with the following variables:
    - `about`, URL for description about each author.
    - `born_date`
    - `born_location`
    - `author_description`


- Find the top 15 most frequently occurred tags.
- Save the two DataFrames in the CSV files.

*Answer*:
```{python}

```
