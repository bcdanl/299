<br>

The dataset ,`beer_markets.csv`, (with its pathname `https://bcdanl.github.io/data/beer_markets.csv`) includes information about beer purchases across different markets, brands, and households.


```{.python}
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
beer = pd.read_csv('https://bcdanl.github.io/data/beer_markets.csv')
```

<br>

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
rmarkdown::paged_table(readr::read_csv('https://bcdanl.github.io/data/beer_markets.csv')
          )
```

- Each observation in `beer` is a household-level transaction record for a purchase of beer.

## Variable Description

- `hh`: an identifier of the household;
- `X_purchase_desc`: details on the purchased item;
- `quantity`: the number of items purchased;
- `brand`: Bud Light, Busch Light, Coors Light, Miller Lite, or Natural Light;
- `dollar_spent`: total dollar value of purchase;
- `beer_floz`: total volume of beer, in fluid ounces;
- `price_per_floz`: price per fl.oz. (i.e., beer spent/beer floz);
- `container`: the type of container;
- `promo`: Whether the item was promoted (coupon or otherwise);
- `market`: Scan-track market (or state if rural);
- demographic data, including gender, marital status, household income, class of work, race, education, age, the size of household, and whether or not the household has a microwave or a dishwasher.





## Question 1

- Provide (1) seaborn code and (2) a simple comment to describe how the distribution of `price_per_floz` varies by `brand`.


*Answer:*
```{python}

```

<br>

## Question 2

- Provide (1) seaborn code and (2) a simple comment to describe how the relationship between `log(price_per_floz)` and `log(beer_floz)` varies by `brand`.
  - Below adds `log(price_per_floz)` and `log(beer_floz)` to the `beer_mkt` DataFrame using `numpy`'s `log()` function:

```{.python}
import numpy as np
beer_mkt['log_price_per_floz'] = np.log( beer_mkt['price_per_floz'] )
beer_mkt['log_beer_floz'] = np.log( beer_mkt['beer_floz'] )
```


*Answer:*
```{python}

rmarkdown::paged_table(readr::read_csv('https://bcdanl.github.io/data/stock_2023_2025.csv')
          )
```


## Question 3
