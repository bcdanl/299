# Question 1
Provide a Python code to get New York City air quality surveillance data using the following API endpoint:

[https://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/c3uy-2p5r.json](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/c3uy-2p5r.json)

-	Use the following query parameter dictionary in your request, which sets the **"$limit"** to control how many rows are returned:

```{.python}
# query parameters (e.g., limit rows)
param_dict = {
    "$limit": 100   # You can increase this to get more observations
}
```


*Answer*:
```{python}

```

# Question 2
- Use the FRED API to retrieve two macroeconomic indicators:
	1.	U.S. Real GDP (`series_id` = "GDPC1")
	2.	U.S. Unemployment Rate (`series_id` = "UNRATE")

- Then, use pandas to replicate the following DataFrame:

<br>

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| eval: true
DT::datatable(
  readr::read_csv("https://bcdanl.github.io/data/fred_rgdp_unemp.csv"),
  rownames = FALSE
)
```

<br>


*Answer*:
```{python}

```
