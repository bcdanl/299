Welcome to DANL 299! 👋 

In this first week, we will explore what you can expect to learn in this course and review the logistics, including the structure of lectures, classes, and assessments, as well as how we will interact throughout the semester. This week also sets the stage for what is ahead by introducing key tools and basics in Python programming.
