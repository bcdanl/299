# **APIs** {background-color="#1c4982"}


## Clients and servers

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="40%"}
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://bcdanl.github.io/lec_figs/webscrapping-client_server.png" width="450px">
</p>

:::
::: {.column width="60%"}
<div style="display:block; margin:50px;"></div>

- Computers connected to the web are called **clients** and **servers**.

:::
::::

- **Clients** are the typical web user's internet-connected devices (e.g., a computer connected to Wi-Fi) and web-accessing software available on those devices (e.g., Firefox, Chrome).
- **Servers** are computers that store webpages, sites, or apps.


- When a client device wants to access a webpage, a copy of the webpage is downloaded from the server onto the client machine to be displayed in the user's web browser.


## Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS)

- **Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)** is a language for clients and servers to speak to each other.
- **Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS)** is an encrypted version of HTTP that provides secure communication between them.

- When we type a web address with "https://" into our browser:
	1.	The browser finds the address of the server that hosts the website.
	2.	The browser and server establish a **secure connection**.
	3.	The browser sends an **HTTPS request** to the server, asking for the website’s content.
	4.	If the server approves the request, it responds with a **200 OK** message and sends the encrypted website data to the client.
	5.	The browser **decrypts and displays** the website securely.


## HTTP Status Codes
:::{.nonincremental}
- The `requests` library is the de facto standard for making HTTP requests in Python.

:::

```{.python}
# library for making HTTPS requests in Python
import requests  
```

<div style="display:block; margin:30px;"></div>

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

```{.python}
p = 'https://bcdanl.github.io/299'
response = requests.get(p)  
print(response.status_code)  
```

-	**200** → The request is successful, and the server sends the requested content.

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

```{.python}
p = 'https://bcdanl.github.io/2990'
response = requests.get(p)  
print(response.status_code)  
```

-	**404 Not Found** → The server cannot find the requested webpage. 
  - This may happen due to a broken link, mistyped URL, or deleted page.

:::

::::



## API: Key Concepts
::: {.incremental}

- API stands for **Application Programming Interface**.
  - It enables <u>data transmission</u> between **client** and **server**.

- **Methods**: The "verbs" that clients use to talk with a server.
  - The main one that we’ll be using is `GET` (i.e., asking a server to retrieve information). Other common methods include `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE`.

- **Requests**: What the **client** asks of the server.
- **Response**: The **server**’s response, which includes 
  - Status Code (e.g., "404" if not found, or "200" if successful);
  - Content (i.e. the content that we’re interested in);
  - Header (i.e., meta-information about the response).

:::

## Understanding the `requests` Method

- **What is `requests`?**
  - A Python library used to make HTTP requests to APIs and websites.
  - Supports methods like `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, etc.

- **Using `requests.get()`:**
  - Sends a `GET` request to retrieve data from a specified URL.
  - Commonly used when fetching data from APIs.

```{.python}
import requests
url = 'https://www.example.com/.....'
param_dicts = {.....}  # Optional, but we often need this
response = requests.get(url, params=param_dicts)
```

- `url`: **API endpoint** where data is requested.
- `param_dicts`: Dictionary of **query parameters** sent with the request.



## API Endpoints
::: {.incremental}
- In the case of web APIs, we can access information directly from the API database if we specify the correct URL(s).
  - These URLs are known as **API endpoints**.

- Navigate your browser to an API endpoint and we'll just see a load of the following format of texts:
  - **JSON** (JavaScript Object Notation), or 
  - XML (Extensible Markup Language).

- We can add a **JSONView**, a browser extension that renders JSON output nicely in Chrome or Firefox.
  - [https://jsonview.com/](https://jsonview.com/)

:::



<!-- ## Common HTTP Methods -->
<!-- ::: {.incremental} -->
<!-- - **GET**: Retrieve data from a server. -->
<!-- - **POST**: Submit data to create a new resource on the server. -->
<!-- - **PUT**: Update an existing resource (or create it if it doesn’t exist). -->
<!-- - **DELETE**: Remove a resource on the server. -->

<!-- ::: -->

## Inspecting the Response Object

- **Key attributes and methods:**
  - `response.status_code`: Returns HTTP status code (e.g., 200 for success).
  - `response.json()`: Converts JSON format data into a Python dictionary.
  - `response.text`: Decoded text version of the `response.content`


- **Best practices:**
  - Always check `status_code` before processing the response.
  - Use `response.json()` for easier handling of JSON data.


## Example: NYC Open Data

::: {.nonincremental}
::: {.panel-tabset}
## (1)

- **NYC Open Data** ([https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us](https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us)) is free
public data published by NYC agencies and other partners.


- Many metropolitan cities have the Open Data websites too:
  - [https://data.lacity.org](https://data.lacity.org)
  - [https://opendata.dc.gov](https://opendata.dc.gov)
  - [https://data.cityofchicago.org](https://data.cityofchicago.org)



## (2)
- Let’s get the NYC's Payroll Data.
  1. Open the web page
[https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Citywide-Payroll-Data-Fiscal-Year-/k397-673e](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Citywide-Payroll-Data-Fiscal-Year-/k397-673e) in your
browser.
  2. Click the "Actions", and then "API"
  3. Copy the API endpoint that appears in the popup box.




## (3)
```{.python}
import requests
import pandas as pd

endpoint = 'https://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/ic3t-wcy2.json'  ## API endpoint
response = requests.get(endpoint)
content = response.json() # to convert JSON response data to a dictionary
df = pd.DataFrame(content)
```

- The `request.get()` method sends a `GET` request to the specified URL.
- `response.json()` automatically convert JSON data into a dictionary. 
  - JSON objects have the same format as Python dictionaries.

:::
:::


## Example: Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED)

::: {.nonincremental}
::: {.panel-tabset}
## (1)
- Most API interfaces will only let you access and download data after you have registered an **API key** with them.

- Let’s download economic data from the FRED [https://fred.stlouisfed.org](https://fred.stlouisfed.org) using its API.

- You need to create an account [https://fredaccount.stlouisfed.org/login/](https://fredaccount.stlouisfed.org/login/) to get an API key for your FRED account.



## (2)
- As with all APIs, a good place to start is the FRED API developer docs [https://fred.stlouisfed.org/docs/api/fred/](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/docs/api/fred/).

- We are interested in *series/observations* [https://fred.stlouisfed.org/docs/api/fred/series_observations.html](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/docs/api/fred/series_observations.html)
  
- The parameters that we will use are `api_key`, `file_type`, and `series_id`.

- Replace "YOUR_API_KEY" with your actual API key in the following web address: [https://api.stlouisfed.org/fred/series/observations?series_id=GNPCA&api_key=YOUR_API_KEY&file_type=json](https://api.stlouisfed.org/fred/series/observations?series_id=GNPCA&api_key=YOUR_API_KEY&file_type=json)




## (3)
- We’re going to go through the `requests`, `json`, and `pandas` libraries.
  - `requests` comes with a variety of features that allow us to interact more flexibly and securely with web APIs.
  
```{.python}
import requests  # to handle API requests
import json      # to parse JSON response data
import pandas as pd
param_dicts = {
  'api_key': 'YOUR_FRED_API_KEY', ## Change to your own key
  'file_type': 'json',
  'series_id': 'GDPC1'    ## ID for US real GDP
}
url = "https://api.stlouisfed.org/"
endpoint = "series/observations"
api_endpoint = url + "fred/" + endpoint   # sum of strings
response = requests.get(api_endpoint, params = param_dicts)
```



## (4)
- `json()`: Converts JSON into a Python dictionary object.
  
```{.python}
# Convert JSON response to Python dictionary.
content = response.json() 

# Extract the "observations" list element.
df = pd.DataFrame( content['observations'] )
```
  
## (5)
- By default, all columns in the DataFrame from `content` are `string`-type.
  - So, we need to convert their types properly.
  - The DataFrame may also contains columns we do not need.

## Data Collection with APIs

Let's do [**Classwork 11**](https://bcdanl.github.io/299/danl-cw/danl-299-cw-11.html)!


# **Using the New York Times API** {background-color="#1c4982"}


## Using the New York Times API

::::{.nonincremental}
::: {.panel-tabset}
## **Step 1**

### Sign Up and Sign In
- Sign up at [**NYTimes Developer Portal**](https://developer.nytimes.com/)
- Verify your NYT Developer account via email you use. 
- Sign in.


## **Step 2**

### Register apps
1. Select My Apps from the user drop-down at the navigation bar.
2. Click + New App to create a new app.
3. Enter a name and description for the app in the New App dialog.
4. Click Create.
5. Click the APIs tab.
6. Click the access toggle to enable or disable access to an API product from the app.

<!-- - Follow steps in [**Get Started**](https://developer.nytimes.com/get-started) -->


## **Step 3**

### Access the API keys
1. Select My Apps from th user drop-down.
2. Click the app in the list.
3. View the API key on the App Details tab.
4. Confirm that the status of the API key is Approved.


## **Step 4**

### Collect Data with `pynytimes`

```{.python}
pip install pynytimes
```

- While [**NYTimes Developer Portal APIs**](https://developer.nytimes.com/apis) provides API documentation, it is time-consuming to go through the documentation.

-	There is an **unofficial** Python library called `pynytimes` that provides a more user-friendly interface for working with the NYTimes API.

- To get started, check out [**Introduction to pynytimes**](https://pynytimes.michadenheijer.com).


## **Examples**

```{.python}
# Settings
from pynytimes import NYTAPI

# Initialize API with your key
nyt = NYTAPI("YOUR_NYTIMES_API_KEY", parse_dates=True)
```

```{.python}
# Top Stories
top_stories = nyt.top_stories()

# Get all the top stories from a specific category
top_climate_stories = nyt.top_stories(section = "climate")
```

```{.python}
# Most Viewed
most_viewed = nyt.most_viewed()

# Get most viewed articles of last 7 or 30 days
most_viewed = nyt.most_viewed(days = 7)
most_viewed = nyt.most_viewed(days = 30)
```


## **Article Search**
```{.python}
from datetime import datetime

# Define the date range
start = datetime(2024, 1, 1)
end = datetime(2024, 12, 31)

# Search articles related to climate within a date range
  # This return only up to 10 articles.
articles = nyt.article_search(
    query="climate",
    dates={"begin": start, "end": end},
)
```

# **Hidden API** {background-color="#1c4982"}


## Hidden API
- Most industry-scale websites display data from their <u>database servers</u>.
  - Many of them do NOT provide <u>official APIs</u> to retrieve data.

- Sometimes, it is possible to find their **hidden APIs** to retrieve data!

- Examples:
  - [Premier League Stats](https://www.premierleague.com/stats)
  - [Nordstrom](https://www.nordstrom.com)



## Hidden API
### How can we find a hidden API?
- On a web-browser (**FireFox** is recommended)
  1. F12 -> Network -> XHR (**X**ML**H**ttp**R**equest)
  2. Refresh the webpage that loads data
  3. Find `json` type response that seems to have data
  4. Right-click that response -> Copy as **cURL** (Client URL)

- On an API tool such as Python [curlconverter](https://curlconverter.com/python/),
  5. Paste the cURL to the *curl command textbox*, and then click "Copy to clipboard" right below the code cell.
  6. Paste it on your Python script, and run it.

## Details on `requests` methods

- Our course contents are limited to the very very basics of the `requests` methods.

- For those who are interested in the Python's `requests`, I recommend the following references:
  - [Python's Requests Library (Guide)](https://realpython.com/python-requests/)
  - [Requests: HTTP for Humans™](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

# **Using [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co)'s Free LLM API** {background-color="#1c4982"}

## What is [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co)?
- A platform hosting thousands of open-source **Language Models (LLMs)**, including text classification, summarization, question-answering, etc.
- **Free to use** for many models via the [**Inference API**](https://huggingface.co/inference-api).


## How to Get a Free Token
1. **Create a Hugging Face account** at [**huggingface.co**](https://huggingface.co/).
2. Go to your **Profile** → **Settings** → **Access Tokens**.
3. Click **New token** → Give it a name → Choose **Read** role.
4. Copy the generated token (looks like: `hf_xxx...`). Keep your API token private.


## Editing API Token Permissions
1. On the **Access Tokens** page, you'll see a list of your existing tokens.
2. Typically, you can select a token and look for an **Edit** or **...** (ellipsis) option to change its permissions.
3. **If you do not see an option to edit permissions**:
   - You may need to **create a new token** with the desired permissions. Some tokens are fixed after creation.
4. Check that you’ve granted the following if you need summarization:
   - **Inference**: “Make calls to Inference Providers”
   - **Repositories (Read)**: “Read access to contents of all repos under your personal namespace”
   - Optionally: other read privileges, if your project needs them.
   
   

## API Endpoint
- **Inference API URL**: Each model has a unique endpoint.
- For example, **facebook/bart-large-cnn** (a summarization model) uses:  
	https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/facebook/bart-large-cnn




## What Does This API Do?
1. **Takes your text** as an input (prompt).
2. **Returns a summarized version** of that text (or some other transformation, depending on the model).
3. **Example**: Summarizing multiple movie plots into one concise paragraph.



## Example Code Snippet


::: {.nonincremental}
::: {.panel-tabset}


## **Prompt**

```{.python}
# Text you'd like to summarize
text_to_summarize = """
Summarize the following movie plot in a sentence.
Four misfits are suddenly pulled through a mysterious portal into a bizarre cubic wonderland that thrives on imagination. 
To get back home they'll have to master this world while embarking on a quest with an unexpected expert crafter.
"""
```


## **Setup**
```{.python}
import requests
# Your Hugging Face token (replace with your real token)
HF_API_TOKEN = "hf_your_real_token_here"

# The summarization model's API URL
API_URL = "https://api-inference.huggingface.co/models/facebook/bart-large-cnn"

# Add your token to the request headers
headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {HF_API_TOKEN}"}
payload = {"inputs": text_to_summarize}
```

1.	`headers`: The "Authorization": "Bearer ..." header lets Hugging Face know you have permission to use their API.
2.	`payload`: The {"inputs": <YOUR_TEXT>} tells the model what text to summarize.
3.	`requests.post()`: Sends your text to the model's endpoint.


## **POST request**

```{.python}
# Send POST request
response = requests.post(API_URL, headers=headers, json=payload)

# Check response and extract the summary
if response.status_code == 200:
    output = response.json()
    summary = output[0]["summary_text"]
    print("\nSummary from Hugging Face Inference API:")
    print(summary)
else:
    print(f"\nAPI request failed with status code {response.status_code}:")
    print(response.text)
```
