# **Premier on Web-scrapping** {background-color="#1c4982"}


## Ethical considerations

> *"If you can see things in your web browser, you can scrape them."*

- Just because you can scrape them doesn't mean you should.
  - In US, it is currently legal to scrape data from the web using automated tools, as long as the data are publicly available.
    - [**hiQ Labs vs. LinkedIn Corp. court ruling**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HiQ_Labs_v._LinkedIn).
 

- It is important to realize that the web scrapping tools are very powerful.
  - It is pretty straightforward to write up a program that can overwhelm a host server.
  - The host server tends to have built-in safeguards that will block you in case of a suspected malicious attack.




## Ethical considerations

- Respect for website owners' **terms of service**.
- Respect for copyright and intellectual property.
- Respect for client servers.
- Respect for privacy.



## Clients and servers

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="40%"}
<p align="center">
  <img src="https://bcdanl.github.io/lec_figs/webscrapping-client_server.png" width="450px">
</p>

:::
::: {.column width="60%"}
<div style="display:block; margin:50px;"></div>

- Computers connected to the web are called **clients** and **servers**.

:::
::::

- **Clients** are the typical web user's internet-connected devices (e.g., a computer connected to Wi-Fi) and web-accessing software available on those devices (e.g., Firefox, Chrome).
- **Servers** are computers that store webpages, sites, or apps.


- When a client device wants to access a webpage, a copy of the webpage is downloaded from the server onto the client machine to be displayed in the user's web browser.



## Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS)

- **Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)** is a language for clients and servers to speak to each other.
- **Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS)** is an encrypted version of HTTP that provides secure communication between them.

- When we type a web address with "https://" into our browser:
	1.	The browser finds the address of the server that hosts the website.
	2.	The browser and server establish a **secure connection**.
	3.	The browser sends an **HTTPS request** to the server, asking for the website’s content.
	4.	If the server approves the request, it responds with a **200 OK** message and sends the encrypted website data to the client.
	5.	The browser **decrypts and displays** the website securely.
  
## HTTP Status Codes

```{.python}
# library for making HTTPS requests in Python
import requests  
```

<div style="display:block; margin:30px;"></div>

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

```{.python}
p = 'https://bcdanl.github.io/210'
response = requests.get(p)  
print(response.status_code)  
print(response.reason)      

```

-	**200 OK** → The request is successful, and the server sends the requested content.

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

```{.python}
p = 'https://bcdanl.github.io/2100'
response = requests.get(p)  
print(response.status_code)  
print(response.reason)       
```

-	**404 Not Found** → The server cannot find the requested webpage. 
  - This may happen due to a broken link, mistyped URL, or deleted page.

:::

::::




## URL

```{r, echo=FALSE, eval = T, out.width = '75%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("https://bcdanl.github.io/lec_figs/URL.png")
```

- An **uniform resource locator (URL)**—commonly know as a “web address”, specifies the location of a resource (such as a web page) on the internet.

- An URL is usually composed of 5 parts
  - The 4th part, the “**query string**”, contains one or more parameters — in this case, there are two parameters: `id` and `cat`. 
  - The 5th part, the “**fragment**”, is an internal page reference and may not be present.



## HTML

- **Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML)** is the standard markup language for creating Web pages. 
  - HTML describes the structure of a Web page.  
  - HTML consists of a series of elements. 
  - HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content.


- HTML elements label pieces of content such as “this is a heading”, “this is a paragraph”, “this is a link”, etc.


## HTML Example

:::{.nonincremental}

- Below is a simple HTML document:

:::

```{.html}
<!DOCTYPE html>
  <html>
    <head>
      <title>Page Title</title>
    </head>
    <body>
      <h1>My First Heading</h1>
      <p>My first paragraph.</p>
    </body>
  </html>
```




## HTML Elements
### tagname
:::{.nonincremental}

- An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag:

:::
```{.html}
<tagname>Content goes here...</tagname>
```


## HTML Elements
- `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration defines that this document is an HTML document. 
- `<html>` element is the root element of an HTML page. 
- `<head>` element contains meta information about the HTML page. 
- `<title>` element specifies a title for the HTML page.
  - `<title>` is shown in the browser’s title bar or in the page’s tab.
- `<body>` element defines the document’s body, and is a container for all the visible contents, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc. 
  - `<h1>` element defines a large heading. 
  - `<p>` element defines a paragraph.



## HTML body



#### `<a>`

```{.html}
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com">This is a link</a>
```

- The `<a>` tag defines an HTML link.



#### `<img>`

```{.html}
<img src="w3schools.jpg" alt="W3Schools.com" width="104" height="142">
```

- The `<img>` tag defines an HTML image.





## HTML Tables

- `<table>` tag defines an HTML table.
  - `<tr>` tag defines each table row.
  - `<th>` tag defines each table header.
  - `<td>` tag defines each data/cell.

## HTML Table Examples

:::{.nonincremental}
- Below is the example HTML table:

:::

```{.html}
<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <th>Firstname</th>
    <th>Lastname</th> 
    <th>Age</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Eve</td>
    <td>Jackson</td>
    <td>94</td>
  </tr>
</table>
```




## HTML Lists
### Unordered lists
```{.html}
<ul>
  <li>Coffee</li>
  <li>Tea</li>
  <li>Milk</li>
</ul>
```


- `<ul>` tag defines an unordered lists.
  - `<li>` tag defines each list item.
  - The list items will be marked with bullets (small black circles) by default.





## HTML Lists
### Ordered lists

```{.html}
<ol>
  <li>Coffee</li>
  <li>Tea</li>
  <li>Milk</li>
</ol>
```

- `<ol>` tag defines an ordered lists.
  - `<li>` tag defines each list item.
  - The list items will be marked with numbers by default.


## `<div>` – Block-Level Container


```{.html}
<div style="background-color:black;color:white;padding:20px;">
  <h2>London</h2>
  <p>London is the capital city of England. It is the most populous city in the United Kingdom, with a metropolitan area of over 13 million inhabitants.</p>
</div>
```


-	**Block-level element** → Starts on a **new line** and stretches to the full width.
	-	Used as a **container** for structuring content.
	-	Has **no required attributes**, but `style`, `class`, and `id` are commonly used.

- `<div>` is used when grouping multiple elements together.

## `<span>` – Inline Container

```{.html}
<p>My mother has <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold">blue</span> eyes and my father has <span style="color:darkolivegreen;font-weight:bold">dark green</span> eyes.</p>
```

-	**Inline element** → Does not start on a new line; only takes up as much space as necessary.
	-	Used to apply styling or scripting to specific text portions.
	-	Has no required attributes, but style, class, and id are commonly used.

- `<span>` is used when styling or modifying a small part of text inside a block.


## HTML source code


- HTML elements can be nested (this means that elements can contain other elements). 
  - All HTML documents consist of nested HTML elements. 


- We can view HTML source for web page.
  - Hit **F12** key (in Chrome or FireFox).
  - Right-click in an HTML page and select `View Page Source` (in Chrome), or similar in other browsers. 
  - Right-click on an element (or a blank area), and choose `Inspect` or `Inspect Element` to see what elements are made up of. 



## HTML Source Code: DOM

- To parse HTML, it is convenient to represent our HTML document as a tree-like structure that contains information in **nodes** and links information through **branches**. 


- This tree-like structure is called the **Document Object Model (DOM)**.
  - DOM is a cross-platform and language-independent interface that treats an XML (eXtensible Markup Language) or HTML document as a tree structure wherein each node is an object representing a part of the document.

## JavaScript (JS) – Adding Interactivity

- **JavaScript (JS)** is a **client-side programming language** that enhances web interactivity.
  - It runs **directly in the user's browser**, reducing server load.
  - JS is often used with **third-party libraries** to expand website functionality.
  - It enables dynamic content, user interactions, and animations.

## Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) – Styling the Web

- **CSS** is used to **design and format** the layout of a webpage.
  - It controls **colors, fonts, text size, background, spacing, and display properties**.
  - **Analogy:**  
    - **HTML** = The structure of a house (walls, roof, foundation).  
    - **CSS** = The decoration (paint, carpet, wallpapers).  
    - **JS** = The interactive elements (automatic doors, lights, smart devices).  

- ✅ **Together, HTML, CSS, and JS form the foundation of modern web development.**
