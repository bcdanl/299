## Instructor
### Economics and Data Science

- Choe, B.H., 2021. "**_Social Media Campaigns, Lobbying and Legislation: Evidence from #climatechange and Energy Lobbies._**"

- **Question**: To what extent do social media campaigns compete with fossil fuel lobbying on climate change legislation?

- Data include:
  - 5.0 million tweets with #climatechange/#globalwarming around the globe;
  - 12.0 million retweets/likes to those tweets;
  - 0.8 million Twitter users who wrote those tweets;
  - 1.4 million Twitter users who retweeted or liked those tweets;
  - 0.3 million US Twitter users with their location at a city level;
  - Firm-level lobbying data (expenses, targeted bills, etc.). 



## Instructor
### Economics and Data Science

- Choe, B.H. and Ore-Monago, T., 2024. "**_Governance and Climate Finance in the Developing World_**"

- **Climate finance** refers to the financial resources allocated for mitigating and adapting to climate change, including support for initiatives that reduce greenhouse gas emissions and enhance resilience to climate impacts.
  - We focus on *transnational financing* that rich countries provide poor countries with financial resources, in order to help them adapt to climate change and mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.
  - Since the GHG emissions in developing countries are rapidly growing, it is crucial to assess the effectiveness of climate finance.
  - Poor governance (e.g., legal system, rule of law, and accountability) can be significant barriers to emissions reductions.


## Instructor
### Economics and Data Science

- Choe, B.H. and Newbold, Steve, "**_Estimating the Value of Statistical Life (VSL) through Big Data_**"

- VSL is the monetary value associated with reducing the risk of death. 
  - How much value would that be? How can we measure it?
  - How do government agencies use the VSL to decide which policies are worth the cost when they reduce the risk of death?

&\,+\, 0.25\times(\text{Project and Website Score})\notag\\ 
&\,+\, 0.50\times(\text{Total Exam Score}).\notag
\end{align}
$$

## Syllabus
### Grading

- You are allowed up to 4 absences without penalty. 
  - Send me an email if you have standard excused reasons (illness, family emergency, transportation problems, etc.).

- For each absence beyond the initial five, there will be a deduction of 1% from the Total Percentage Grade.

- Participation will be evaluated by quantity and quality of GitHub-based online discussions and in-person discussion.

- The single lowest homework score will be dropped when calculating the total homework score.

  

## Syllabus
### Grading

$$
\begin{align}
&(\text{Midterm Exam Score}) \\

&\qquad\;\,\left.0.33\times(\text{Midterm Exam I Score}) \,+\, 0.67\times(\text{Midterm Exam II Score})\right\}.\notag
\end{align}
$$

- The Midterm Exam Score is the maximum between 
  1. the simple average of the Midterm Exam I score and the Midterm Exam II Score and
  2. the weighted average of them with one-third weight on the Midterm Exam I Score and two-third weight on the Midterm Exam II Score.

## Syllabus
### Make-up Policy

-  Make-up exams will not be given unless you have either a medically verified excuse or an absence excused by the University.

- If you cannot take exams because of religious obligations, notify me by email at least two weeks in advance so that an alternative exam time may be set.

- A missed exam without an excused absence earns a grade of zero.

- Late submissions for homework assignment will be accepted with a penalty. 

- A zero will be recorded for a missed assignment.




## Syllabus
### Academic Integrity and Plagiarism

-  All homework assignments and exams must be the original work by you.

## Why Data Analytics?

- Fill in the gaps left by traditional business and economics classes.
  - Practical skills that will benefit your future career.
  - Neglected skills like how to actually find datasets in the wild and clean them.

- Data analytics skills are largely distinct from (and complementary to) the core quantitative works familiar to business undergrads.
  - Data visualization, cleaning and wrangling; databases; machine learning; etc.

- In short, we will cover things that I wish someone had taught me when I was undergraduate.

## Why Data Analytics?

- **Data analysts** use analytical tools and techniques to extract meaningful insights from data.
  - Skills in data analytics are also useful for **business analysts**, **market analysts**, **financial analysts**, **human resource analysts**, or **economists**.


- [Breau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/math/data-scientists.htm){target="_blank"} forecasts that the projected growth rate of the employment in the industry related to data analytics from 2021 to 2031 is **36%**. 
  - The average growth rate for all occupations is **5%**.

## Data Analytics and Generative AI

- **Generative AI** refers to a category of AI that is capable of generating new content, ranging from text, images, and videos to music and code. 

:::{.incremental}

- In the early 2020s, advances in transformer-based deep neural networks enabled a number of generative AI systems notable for accepting natural language prompts as input.
  - These include large language model (LLM) chatbots (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Copilot, Grok).

- **ChatGPT** (Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer) is a chatbot developed by OpenAI and launched on November 30, 2022. 
  - By January 2023, it had become what was then the fastest-growing consumer software application in history.

  - An R script is simply a text file containing R commands. 
  - RStudio will color-code different elements of your code to make it easier to read.

## Installing the Tools
### R Packages and `tidyverse`

- **R packages** are collections of R functions, compiled code, and data that are combined in a structured format.


:::{.incremental}

- The `tidyverse` is a collection of R packages designed for data science that share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures. 
  - The `tidyverse` packages work harmoniously together to make data manipulation, exploration, and visualization more.
  - We will use several R packages from `tidyverse` throughout the course. (e.g., `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `tidyr`)

:::


## Installing the Tools
### Installing R packages with `install.packages("packageName")`

- R packages can be easily installed from within R using functions  `install.packages("packageName")`. 
  - To install the R package `tidyverse`, type and run the following from R console:

:::{.incremental}
```{.r}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```


- While running the above codes, you may encounter the question below from the R Console:


:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

- **Mac**: *"Do you want to install from sources the packages which need compilation?"* from Console Pane.
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

- **Windows**: *"Would you like to use a personal library instead?"* from Pop-up message.
:::
::::

- Type `no` in the R Console, and then hit *Enter*.

:::

## Installing the Tools
### Loading R packages with `library(packageName)`

- Once installed, a package is loaded into an R session using `library(packageName)` so that its functions and data can be used.
  - To load the R package `tidyverse`, type and run the following command from a R script:

```{.r}
library(tidyverse)
df_mpg <- mpg
```

:::{.incremental}
- `mpg` is the data.frame provided by the R package `ggplot2`, one of the R pakcages in `tidyverse`.
