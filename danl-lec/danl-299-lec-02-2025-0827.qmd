## Why Data Analytics?

- Fill in the gaps left by traditional business and economics classes.
  - Practical skills that will benefit your future career.
  - Neglected skills like how to actually find datasets in the wild and clean them.

- Data analytics skills are largely distinct from (and complementary to) the core quantitative works familiar to business undergrads.
  - Data visualization, cleaning and wrangling; databases; machine learning; etc.

- In short, we will cover things that I wish someone had taught me when I was undergraduate.

## Why Data Analytics?

- **Data analysts** use analytical tools and techniques to extract meaningful insights from data.
  - Skills in data analytics are also useful for **business analysts**, **market analysts**, **financial analysts**, **human resource analysts**, or **economists**.


- [Breau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/math/data-scientists.htm){target="_blank"} forecasts that the projected growth rate of the employment in the industry related to data analytics from 2021 to 2031 is **36%**. 
  - The average growth rate for all occupations is **5%**.

## Data Analytics and Generative AI

- **Generative AI** refers to a category of AI that is capable of generating new content, ranging from text, images, and videos to music and code. 

:::{.incremental}

- In the early 2020s, advances in transformer-based deep neural networks enabled a number of generative AI systems notable for accepting natural language prompts as input.
  - These include large language model (LLM) chatbots (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Copilot, Grok).

- **ChatGPT** (Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer) is a chatbot developed by OpenAI and launched on November 30, 2022. 
  - By January 2023, it had become what was then the fastest-growing consumer software application in history.

:::



## Data Analytics and Generative AI

  
- Users around the world have explored how to best utilize GPT for writing essays and programming codes.


::::{.incremental}

:::{}
- Is AI a threat to data analytics?
  - Fundamental understanding of the subject matter is still crucial for effectively utilizing AI's capabilities.
  
:::

:::{}
- If you use Generative AI such as ChatGPT, please try to understand what ChatGPT gives you.
  - Copying and pasting it without any understanding harms your learning opportunity.

## What is R?

- **R** is a programming language and software environment designed for statistical computing and graphics. 

- R has become a major tool in data analysis, statistical modeling, and visualization. 
  - It is widely used among statisticians and data scientists for developing statistical software and performing data analysis. 
  - R is open source and freely available. 


## What is RStudio?

- **RStudio** is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R. 
  - An IDE is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities (e.g., text code editor, graphical user interface (GUI)) to computer programmers for software development. 

- RStudio is a user-friendly interface that makes using R easier and more interactive. 
  - It provides a console, syntax-highlighting editor that supports direct code execution, as well as tools for plotting, history, debugging, and workspace management.

- We will use a free cloud version of RStudio, which is [**Posit Cloud**](https://posit.cloud).



## What is Python?

- **Python** is a versatile programming language known for its simplicity and readability.

- Python has become a dominant tool in various fields including data analysis, machine learning, and web development.
  - It is widely used among developers, data scientists, and researchers for building applications and performing data-driven tasks.
  - Python is open source and has a vast ecosystem of libraries and frameworks.



## What is Jupyter?

- **Jupyter** is an open-source integrated development environment (IDE) primarily for Python, though it supports many other languages.
  - Jupyter provides a notebook interface that allows users to write and execute code in a more interactive and visual format.

- Jupyter Notebook is a user-friendly environment that enhances coding, data analysis, and visualization.
  - It offers a web-based interface that combines live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text.
  - Jupyter is widely used for data science, machine learning, and research, enabling easy sharing and collaboration.

- You can use a free cloud version of Jupyter, which is [**Google Colab**](https://colab.research.google.com).
  - Google Colab can be used for R as well.

$\quad$

- **Git** is the most popular **version control** tool for any software development.
  - It tracks changes in a series of snapshots of the project, allowing developers to revert to previous versions, compare changes, and merge different versions. 
  - It is the industry standard and ubiquitous for coding collaboration.

## What is GitHub?

- [GitHub](https://github.com/){target="_blank"} is a web-based hosting platform for Git repositories to store, manage, and share code. 

- Our course website is hosted on a GitHub repository.

- Course contents will be posted not only in Brightspace but also in my GitHub repositories ("repos").

- Github is useful for many reasons, but the main reason is how user friendly it makes uploading and sharing code.

### R Packages and `tidyverse`

- **R packages** are collections of R functions, compiled code, and data that are combined in a structured format.


:::{.incremental}

- The `tidyverse` is a collection of R packages designed for data science that share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures. 
  - The `tidyverse` packages work harmoniously together to make data manipulation, exploration, and visualization more.
  - We will use several R packages from `tidyverse` throughout the course. (e.g., `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `tidyr`)

:::


## Installing the Tools
### Installing R packages with `install.packages("packageName")`

- R packages can be easily installed from within R using functions  `install.packages("packageName")`. 
  - To install the R package `tidyverse`, type and run the following from R console:

:::{.incremental}
```{.r}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```


- While running the above codes, you may encounter the question below from the R Console:

## Installing the Tools
### Loading R packages with `library(packageName)`

- Once installed, a package is loaded into an R session using `library(packageName)` so that its functions and data can be used.
  - To load the R package `tidyverse`, type and run the following command from a R script:

```{.r}
library(tidyverse)
df_mpg <- mpg
```

:::{.incremental}
