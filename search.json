We will use a computing development environment, Jupyter Notebook, which is a shell and notebook for exploratory computing. This course will cover topics such as (1) loading, cleaning, transforming, merging, and reshaping data, (2) creating informative visualizations, (3) dataset slicing, dicing, and summarizing, and (4) collecting data via web scraping and application programming interfaces (APIs). We will cover these topics to solve real-world data analysis problems with thorough, detailed examples. Computing is done in Python. Throughout the course, students will gain hands-on experience with Python and its data analysis libraries (e.g., pandas, seaborn, requests, selenium), along with practical applications of git and GitHub. We will use Python in a Jupyter Notebook environment, along with practical applications of Git and GitHub.\n\n\nSchool of Business Mission\nThe School of Business at SUNY Geneseo is committed to exceptional business and economics education within the context of a strong liberal arts tradition.

If you anticipate challenges that may affect your attendance, please reach out—I am happy to work with you to help you stay on track.\n\n\nGrading\n\nTotal Percentage Grade\n\nAttendance: 5%\n\nHomework: 20% (single lowest homework score dropped)\n\nProject: 25%\n\nExams: 50%\n\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\quad\\\\\n&\\text{(Total Percentage Score)} \\\\\n= &\\quad\\; 0.05 \\times \\text{(Attendance)} \\\\\n&+ 0.05 \\times \\text{(Quiz \\& Participation)}\\\\\n&+ 0.20 \\times \\text{(Homework)}\\\\\n&+ 0.20 \\times \\text{(Project)}\\\\\n&+ 0.50 \\times \\text{(Exams)}\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\nExam Score Calculations\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n&\\quad(\\text{Midterm Exam Score})\\\\\n&= \\max\\left\\{0.50 \\times \\text{(Midterm 1 Score)} + 0.50 \\times \\text{(Midterm 2 Score)},\\right.\\\\\n&\\qquad\\quad\\;\\;\\,\\left.0.33 \\times \\text{(Midterm 1 Score)} + 0.67 \\times \\text{(Midterm 2 Score)}\\right\\}.\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\nThe Midterm Exam Score will be the higher of the following two calculations:\n\nThe simple average of Midterm Exam 1 and Midterm Exam 2\nThe weighted average, with one-third weight on Midterm Exam 1 and two-thirds weight on Midterm Exam 2\n\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n&\\quad(\\text{Total Exam Score})\\\\\n&= \\max\\left\\{0.50 \\times \\text{(Midterm Exam Score)} + 0.50 \\times \\text{(Final Exam Score)},\\right.\\\\\n&\\qquad\\quad\\;\\;\\,\\left.0.25 \\times \\text{(Midterm Exam Score)} + 0.75 \\times \\text{(Final Exam Score)}\\right\\}.\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\nThe Total Exam Score will be the higher of the following two calculations:\n\nThe simple average of Midterm Exam and Final Exam\nThe weighted average, with one-fourth weight on Midterm Exam and three-forth weight on Final Exam.\n\nLetter Grade Scale\nTotal percentage scores are converted to letter grades according to the following ranges:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{align}\n100 &≥ A ≥ 93 &gt; A− ≥ 90\\\\\n90 &&gt; B+ ≥ 87 &gt; B ≥ 83 &gt; B− ≥ 80\\\\\n80 &&gt; C+ ≥ 77 &gt; C ≥ 73 &gt; C− ≥ 70\\\\\n70 &&gt; D ≥ 60 &gt; E\n\\end{align}\n\\]\n\n\nPolicies\n\nMake-up Exams\nMake-up exams will not be given unless you have either a medically verified excuse or an absence excused by the University. For religious obligations, notify the instructor by email at least two weeks in advance to set an alternative time. A missed exam without an excused absence earns a grade of zero.\n\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI)\nUnless AI tools are explicitly permitted for homework or in-class quizzes, you must complete your work independently. Using tools like ChatGPT for any aspect of coursework is a form of academic dishonesty and undermines the development of your own skills. If you have questions, please ask.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n📝 If you use AI for a particular assignment and/or project, you must also:\n\n📝 You must document which AI platforms and tools you used.\n📤 You must include your prompts and AI outputs with your assignment submission.\n🧠 You must include a reflection on your AI usage and learning process.\n\n\n\n\nAcademic Integrity and Plagiarism\nAll homework assignments and exams must be your original work. Academic dishonesty will not be tolerated. Examples include:\n\nRepresenting the work, thoughts, or ideas of another person as your own\n\nAllowing others to represent your work, thoughts, or ideas as theirs\n\nBeing complicit in academic dishonesty by suspecting or knowing of it and not taking action\n\nSee: Academic Dishonesty Policy and Procedures and Plagiarism Tutorial Brightspace Link\n\n\n\n\nAccessibility\nSUNY Geneseo is dedicated to providing an equitable and inclusive educational experience for all students. The Office of Accessibility (OAS) will coordinate reasonable accommodations for persons with disabilities to ensure equal access to academic programs, activities, and services offered by SUNY Geneseo.\nStudents with approved accommodations may submit a semester request to renew their academic accommodations. More information on the process for requesting academic accommodations is on the OAS website.\nQuestions? Contact the OAS by email, phone, or in-person:\nOffice of Accessibility Services\nErwin Hall 22\n585-245-5112\naccess@geneseo.edu\n\n\nPublic Health and Class Attendance\nIf you are experiencing symptoms associated with COVID on a day that class meets in-person, do not attend. Communicate proactively about absences and contact the Dean of Students if you expect to be out for an extended period.\n\n\nReligious Observations and Class Attendance\nNew York State Education Law 224-a stipulates that “any student in an institution of higher education who is unable, because of [their] religious beliefs, to attend classes on a particular day or days shall, because of such absence on the particular day or days, be excused from any examination or any study or work requirements” (see General Classroom Policies for more information). SUNY Geneseo has a commitment to inclusion and belonging, and I want to stress my respect for the diverse identities and faith traditions of students in my class. If you anticipate an absence due to religious observations, please contact me as soon as possible in advance to discuss your needs and arrange make up plans. The New York State Department of Civil Service maintains a calendar of major religious observations.\n\n\nMilitary Obligations and Class Attendance\nFederal and New York State law requires institutions of higher education to provide an excused leave of absence from classes without penalty to students enrolled in the National Guard or armed forces reserves who are called to active duty. If you are called to active military duty and need to miss classes, please let me know and consult as soon as possible with the Dean of Students.\n\n\nBias-Related Incidents\n\n“We are here to listen, to learn, to teach, to debate, to change, to grow. We should all be safe to pursue these goals at SUNY Geneseo while being who we are. Together, we commit ourselves to pluralism, cultivating a community that respects difference and promotes a sense of inclusion and belonging.”\n\nAs this excerpt from our Community Commitment to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion states, here at SUNY Geneseo, we want to provide a space where everyone feels welcome to learn and grow in their identities as well as in their role as students, faculty, and staff. If in the unfortunate instance you witness or experience an incident of bias, we encourage you to reach out to the Chief Diversity Officer, Director of Multicultural Affairs, and/or our University Police Department. You may also choose to report it through the bias-related incident reporting form. In trying to create an environment that facilitates growth through diverse thoughts and ideas, reporting incidents of bias - including threats, vandalism, and microaggressive behaviors - can help bring a better understanding of our campus climate as well as provide opportunities for learning and restoring harm.\n\n\n\nPersonal Health, Well-being, and Basic Needs\n\nWell-Being\nPrioritizing well-being can support the achievement of academic goals and alleviate stress. Eating nutritious foods, getting enough sleep, exercising, avoiding drugs and alcohol, maintaining healthy relationships, and building in time to relax all help promote a healthy lifestyle and general well-being. Your health and wellbeing are foundational to your ability to learn, and if you find that you are feeling unwell (physically or mentally) and it is impacting your ability to complete your coursework, please reach out. In a similar way, I will occasionally ask for some patience and flexibility on your part.\nIf I am slow responding to an email, if I take some time to grade an assignment, or if I am a bit late posting course materials, please be patient (and feel free to send me a ‘nudge’; I will not be offended). You will never suffer any disadvantage in the course because of delays on my part. Remember that we are all in this together.\n\n\nBasic Needs Statement\nIn order to foster a sense of belonging and connection, a state of financial, mental, emotional and physical stability must be achieved. If you are facing food insecurity, displacement, an emergency, crisis, or health-related or medical expense, you are not alone. Concerns about academic performance, health situations, family health and wellness (including the loss of a loved one), interpersonal relationships and commitments, and other factors can contribute to stress. Students are strongly encouraged to communicate their needs to faculty and staff and seek support if they are experiencing unmanageable stress or are having difficulties with daily functioning. The Dean of Students (585-245-5706) can assist and provide direction to appropriate campus resources. For more information, visit the Dean of Students Office website.\n\n\nMental Health\nAs a student, you may experience a range of challenges that can impact your mental health and thus impact your learning; common examples include increased anxiety, shifts in mood, strained relationships, difficulties related to substance use, trouble concentrating, and lack of motivation, among many others. These experiences may reduce your ability to participate fully in daily activities and affect your academic performance.\nSUNY Geneseo offers free, confidential counseling for students through Student Health and Counseling, and seeking support for your mental health can be key to your success at college. You can learn more about the various mental health services available on campus online. To request a counseling appointment, please complete the online form.\n\n\nGuidelines for Attendance and Public Health\nSUNY Geneseo is a residential liberal arts college where we all learn together in a shared space. This classroom community is vital for engaging in discussions, solving problems, and answering questions together. Learning is an active process, and it requires engagement - on my part and yours. I promise to create an interactive and collaborative classroom space, and in return I expect you to attend and engage in the activities.\nIt’s possible that some of you may get sick over the course of the semester. Because we want you to be successful and because we value your contribution to the course, we expect you to prioritize attendance. If you are not feeling well and your symptoms do not allow you to attend class, stay home (except to go to the health center), rest, and take care of yourself. You can find more guidelines from the Center for Disease Control for precautions when sick which cover flu, COVID, and other illnesses.\nI expect you to communicate with me directly about your absences. I can support you to keep up with class if you are out for an illness, but I need you to take responsibility for being transparent and clear in letting me know when you are out and why. Although I can work with you on keeping up, you may miss some course content and extended absences may impact your ability to realize your full potential in this class. For extended absences (i.e., more than a couple of days of classes), you should contact the Dean of Students who can assist with reaching out to your faculty.\n\n\nFood Security for SUNY Geneseo Students\nSUNY Geneseo is committed to supporting students who are experiencing food insecurity. If you’re unfamiliar with the phrase “food insecurity,” you can learn more at the following link on Feeding America’s website: Understanding Food Insecurity.\nKnights’ Harvest Pantry, our on-campus food pantry, is a collaborative initiative supported by Campus Auxiliary Services (CAS) and facilitated by trained student volunteers. The program is advised by the Assistant Director of Student Volunteerism and Community Engagement in partnership with the Geneseo Opportunities for Leadership Development (GOLD) program.\nStudents who are in need can confidentially request a bag of food and basic hygiene supplies through our website. These bags typically include non-perishable items and, when available, fresh fruits, vegetables, meat, and dairy products. Pickups take place at the GOLD Leadership Center in MacVittie College Union, Room 114.\nWe are committed to protecting student privacy and promoting dignity, while also working to destigmatize food insecurity on our campus. If Knights’ Harvest Pantry does not fully meet your needs or if you’d prefer to discuss your situation privately, please reach out to Cheyenne DeMarco, Assistant Director of Student Volunteerism and Community Engagement, at cdemarco@geneseo.edu for a one-on-one consultation.\nPlease note that Knights’ Harvest Pantry is closed during official SUNY breaks, including Fall Break, Winter Intersession, Spring Break, and summer between semesters. During these times, students are encouraged to access the Geneseo-Groveland Emergency Food Pantry, located at 31 Center Street, Geneseo, NY 14454. For updates on pantry hours, events, and additional support opportunities, follow us on Instagram or Facebook: @knightsharvestgeneseo. For questions or support, contact Cheyenne DeMarco at cdemarco@geneseo.edu or (585) 245-5893.\n\n\nEmergency Funding\nThe college has three sources of emergency funding for students experiencing short-term financial crises. The Camiolo Student Emergency Loan Fund (SELF) provides short-term loans to students for situations both temporary and beyond their control. The SELF was established with the expectation that students who use the fund seek to “pay it forward” as soon as they are able by contributing to the fund so other students can be helped, too. While there is not a legal obligation, the donors hope that student loan recipients respect and honor the value of community and helping others in their time of crisis. The One Knight Student Aid Emergency Fund assists Geneseo students who are facing financial emergencies mainly related to the COVID-19 pandemic. The fund offers grants (one-time award) depending on a student’s documented financial need. For those students expecting a refund from financial aid, a Temple Hill loan of up to $500 can be offered prior to the approved loan dispersal. If you are experiencing financial hardship, please contact the Dean of Students (585-245-5706), who can assist and provide direction to appropriate campus resources.\n\n\n\nSUNY Geneseo’s Commitments, Mission and Values\nSUNY Geneseo has several core documents that articulate our shared commitments and learning objectives. These include:\n\nSUNY Geneseo Mission, Vision and Values\nCommunity Commitment to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion\nSustainability as a Core Value\nGeneseo Learning Outcomes for Baccalaureate Education\n\n\n\nDisclaimer\nThe syllabus may be subject to change during the semester. If it is changed, you will be notified via email and Brightspace.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "1. Data Collection\nFor data collection, include only the companies that are common to both the esg_proj_2024_data and esg_proj_2025 DataFrames.\n\nScraping web data falls into a legal gray area. In the U.S., scraping publicly available information is not illegal, but it is not always clearly allowed either.\n\nMost companies do not go after individuals for minor or non-commercial violations of their Terms of Service (ToS). Still, if the scraping causes harm, it can lead to legal trouble.\n\nTips for Collecting Data from Yahoo! Finance:\n\nScrape at a reasonable and moderate rate. To avoid overloading servers, use time.sleep(random.uniform(5, y)) between page visits.\nThe method of explicit waits are not required, but they are helpful for ensuring elements load before scraping.\nBe aware that some companies may not have data available for Environmental, Social, or Governance Risk Scores, or Controversy Level.\nConsider starting with the following setup for Selenium web-scrapping\n\n\n# %%\n# =============================================================================\n# Setup libraries\n# =============================================================================\nimport time\nimport random\nimport pandas as pd\nimport os\nfrom selenium import webdriver\nfrom selenium.webdriver.common.by import By\nfrom selenium.webdriver.chrome.options import Options\nfrom selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait\nfrom selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC\n\n# %%\n# =============================================================================\n# Setup working directory\n# =============================================================================\nwd_path = 'PATHNAME_OF_YOUR_WORKING_DIRECTORY'\nos.chdir(wd_path)\n\n\n# %%\n# =============================================================================\n# Setup WebDriver with options\n# =============================================================================\noptions = Options()\noptions.add_argument(\"window-size=1400,1200\")  # Set window size\noptions.add_argument('--disable-blink-features=AutomationControlled')  # Prevent detection of automation by disabling blink features\noptions.page_load_strategy = 'eager'  # Load only essential content first, skipping non-critical resources\n\ndriver = webdriver.Chrome(options=options)\n\n\na. ESG Data\n\nFor each company in the esg_proj_2025 DataFrame, employ the Python selenium library to gather ESG Risk Ratings, along with the Controversy Level from the Sustainability section of each company’s webpage on Yahoo! Finance, such as:\n\nApple Inc. (AAPL)\nMicrosoft Corporation (MSFT)\n\n\n\n\n\nb. Historical Stock Data\n\nFor each company found in both the esg_proj_2024_data and esg_proj_2025 DataFrames, employ the selenium library to retrieve:\n\nDaily stock prices from January 1, 2024, to March 31, 2025\n\ne.g., https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT/history/?p=MSFT&period1=1704067200&period2=1743446400\n1704067200 = January 1, 2024\n1743446400 = March 31, 2025\n\n\nNote: GOOGLEFINANCE function in Google Sheets is freely available for retrieving current or historical stock data.\n\nAlthough our course does not cover Google Sheets, you are welcome to use it to collect historical stock data if you prefer.\nIf you choose Google Sheets’ GOOGLEFINANCE() for collecting historical stock data, please share your Google Sheets with Prof. Choe.\n\n\n\n\nDividend Cleaning\nIf you scrape historical data tables from each company’s page on Yahoo Finance (e.g., MSFT Historical Data), you can construct a DataFrame similar to the df_all DataFrame shown below.\nThe df_all DataFrame contains stock data for Apple Inc., Microsoft, and Nvidia from the beginning of 2024 through the end of Q1 2025:\nimport pandas as pd\ndf_all = pd.read_csv('https://bcdanl.github.io/data/aapl_msft_nvda_2024_2025.csv')\n\n\n\n  \n\n\nNote that some rows in the df_all DataFrame include dividend declarations rather than price and volume data (e.g., Apple Inc. on February 10, 2025; Microsoft on February 20, 2025). These dividend entries appear in the Open/High/Low/Close/Adj Close/Volume columns as strings like “0.25 Dividend”.\n\nNote: Apple Inc’s “0.25 Dividend” means that on that specific date, Apple Inc issued a cash dividend of $0.01 per share.\n\nTo separate these dividend entries from the actual stock trading data, we use the str.contains() method:\n# Filter rows where the 'Open' column contains the word 'Dividend' (these represent dividend entries)\ndf_dividend = df_all[df_all['Open'].str.contains('Dividend', na=False)]\n\n# Filter out dividend rows to keep only stock price data\ndf_stock = df_all[~df_all['Open'].str.contains('Dividend', na=False)]\n\nAt this point:\n\ndf_stock does not include dividend announcements.\ndf_dividend includes only dividend announcements.\n\n\nWe now clean and format the dividend information:\n# Select only relevant columns for dividend data\ndf_dividend = df_dividend[['Date', 'Symbol', 'Open']]\n\n# Copy 'Open' column (which contains dividend information) into a new column named 'Dividend'\ndf_dividend['Dividend'] = df_dividend['Open']\n\n# Keep only the necessary columns: Date, Symbol, and Dividend\ndf_dividend = df_dividend[['Date', 'Symbol', 'Dividend']]\n\n# Remove the text \" Dividend\" from the Dividend column to isolate the numeric value\ndf_dividend['Dividend'] = df_dividend['Dividend'].str.replace(' Dividend', '')\n\n\n\nStock Split Cleaning\nSimilarly, some row in the df_stock DataFrame from the “Dividend Cleaning” subsection includes stock splits rather than price and volume data (e.g., Nvidia on June 10, 2024). These stock split entries appear in the Open/High/Low/Close/Adj Close/Volume columns as strings like “10:1 Stock Splits”.\nTo separate these stock split entries from the actual stock trading data, again we use the str.contains() method:\n# Filter rows where the 'Open' column contains the word 'Split' (these represent stock split entries)\ndf_split = df_stock[df_stock['Open'].str.contains('Split', na=False)]\n\n# Filter out dividend rows to keep only stock price data\ndf_stock = df_stock[~df_stock['Open'].str.contains('Split', na=False)]\n\nAt this point:\n\ndf_stock includes only daily stock trading information.\ndf_split includes only stock splits.\n\n\nWe now clean and format the split information:\n# Select only relevant columns for dividend data\ndf_split = df_split[['Date', 'Symbol', 'Open']]\n\n# Copy 'Open' column (which contains dividend information) into a new column named 'Split'\ndf_split['Split'] = df_split['Open']\n\n# Keep only the necessary columns: Date, Symbol, and Split\ndf_split = df_split[['Date', 'Symbol', 'Split']]\n\n# Remove the text \" Stock Splits\" from the Split column to isolate the numeric value\ndf_split['Split'] = df_split['Split'].str.replace(' Stock Splits', '')\n\nNote: NVDA’s “10:1 Stock Split” means that each existing share was split into 10 shares.\n\nIf you owned 1 share before June 10, 2024, you would own 10 shares after the split.\nTo maintain consistency, Yahoo Finance retroactively adjusts all historical prices and volumes to reflect stock splits.\n\nFor example, the table below shows NVDA’s adjusted stock prices and volumes from June 7–11, 2024:\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nExtracting the year from a datetime variable\n\nTo extract the year from a datetime variable in a pandas DataFrame, you can use the .dt.year accessor.\n\n# Sample DataFrame with string dates\ndata = {\n    'Symbol': ['AAPL', 'MSFT', 'GOOG'],\n    'Date': ['2024-12-29', '2024-12-30', '2025-01-03'],\n    'Close': [130.21, 265.78, 122.34]\n}\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame(data)\n\n# Convert 'Date' column to datetime\ndf['Date'] = df['Date'].astype('datetime64[ns]')\n\n# Extract year from 'Date' variable\ndf['Year'] = df['Date'].dt.year"

    "text": "General Tips on Data Visualization 📈\n\nDistribution\nWhen describing the distribution of a variable, we are typically interested in several key characteristics:\n\nCenter: The central tendency of the data, such as the mean or median, which indicates the typical or average value.\nSpread: How spread the values are within the variable, showing the range and standard deviation of values.\nCommon Values: Identifying frequent values and the mode.\nRare Values: Recognizing unusual or infrequent values.\nShape: The overall shape of the distribution, such as whether it’s symmetric, skewed left or right, or having multiple groups with multiple peaks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelationship Between Two Variables\n\nStart with determining whether the two variables have a positive association, a negative association, or no association.\n\n\nE.g., A negative slope in the fitted line indicates that sales decrease as the price increases, while a positive slope would indicate that sales increase with price. A zero slope means that there is no relationship between sales and price; changes in price do not affect sales.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInput on the x-axis; output on the y-axis\n\n\nBy convention, the input (or predictor) variable is plotted on the x-axis, and the output (or response) variable on the y-axis.\nThis helps visualize potential relationships—though it shows correlation, not necessarily causation.\nCorrelation does not necessarily mean causation.\n\n\nWhen a question asks you to describe how the relationship varies by another categorical variable, examine both the direction of the slope (negative, positive, or none) from the fitted line and the steepness of the slope (steep or shallow).\n\n\nThe slope of the fitted straight line is the rate at which the “y” variable (like grades) changes as the “x” variable (like study hours) changes. In simple terms, it shows how much one thing goes up or down when the other thing changes.\nFor example, a comment such as, “The plot shows a negative relationship between sales and price” does not address how the relationship differs by brand.\n\n\nThe focus is on the relationship, not the distribution.\n\n\nWhile adding a comment on the distribution of a single variable can be helpful, the question is primarily about the relationship between the two variables.\n\n\n\n\nTime Trend of a Variable\nHere are some general tips for describing the time trend of a variable:\n\nStart with Identifying the Overall Trend\n\n\nLook for the general direction of the trend over time.\n\nIs it moving upward, downward, or remaining relatively constant?\n\n\n\nNote Patterns and Cycles\n\n\nIdentify any repeating patterns, such as seasonal fluctuations (e.g., monthly or quarterly changes) or long-term cycles.\n\nThese can reveal consistent influences that affect the variable over time.\n\n\n\nHighlight Any Significant Fluctuations\n\n\nDescribe any sharp increases, decreases, or irregular spikes in the data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterpreting Visualization\n\nBe specific.\n\nAvoid vague statements. Below examples do not actually explain what the patterns are.\n\n“The plot shows how the time trend of a stock price varies across sectors, with each sector having a unique best fitting line and scatter pattern”\n“The trend shows the evolution of stock price in the market over time”\n\nClearly describe what is the pattern—and how it differs across categories.\n\nAdd Narration:\n\nConnect the visualization to real-world phenomena and/or your idea that could help explain it, adding insight into what is happening."

    "text": "Getting a GitHub account\nStep 1. Create the GitHub account with your Geneseo email.\n\nGo to GitHub.\nClick “Sign up for GitHub”.\n\n\nChoose your GitHub username carefully:\n\nhttps://USERNAME.github.io will be the address for your website.\nByeong-Hak’s GitHub username is bcdanl, so that Byeong-Hak owns the web address https://bcdanl.github.io.\n\nIt is recommended to have a username with all lower cases.\n\n\n\n\n\nInstalling git if you do not have one.\nStep 2.\n\nCheck whether git is installed in your laptop.\n\n\nFrom the Console Pane in RStudio, click Terminal tab.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the Terminal, run the following command to check if your laptop has git installed.\n\ngit --version\n\nIf your computer has git installed, you will see the message below and you do not need to install git:\n\ngit version 2.xx\n\nIf your computer does not have git installed, you will see the message below and you need to install git:\n\n'git' is not recognized as an internal or external command\n\n\nInstall git if you do not have one. Move to the next step if you have git installed in your laptop.\n\n\n\n\nMac\n\nGo to http://git-scm.com/downloads, and download the file.\nClick “macOS”, scroll down the webpage, and then click “installer” from the Binary installer section.\nRun the downloaded file.\n\n\n\n\nWindows\n\nGo to https://gitforwindows.org, and download the file.\nRun the downloaded file.\n\n\n\n\n\nKeep clicking “Next” to complete the installation of git.\nAfter the git installation is done, close RStudio and re-open it.\n\n\nHow to open git installation file on Mac?\n\nRun the downloaded file.\nClick Okay\nGo to “Setting” &gt; “Privacy and Security”\nGo to “General” or scroll down\nClick “Open Anyway”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetting up GitHub Credential on your local Git.\nStep 3. In Terminal, run the following commands one by one:\ngit config --global user.email \"YOUR_EMAIL_ADDRESS\"\ngit config --global user.name \"YOUR_USERNAME\"\nFor example, the email address for my GitHub account is bchoe@geneseo.edu, and my GitHub username is bcdanl, so that I ran below:\ngit config --global user.email \"bchoe@geneseo.edu\"\ngit config --global user.name \"bcdanl\"\n\nStep 4. Obtain a personal access token (PAT) from GitHub.\n\nIn RStudio Console, run the followings line by line:\n\ninstall.packages(\"usethis\")\nusethis::create_github_token()\n\nThen, click “Generate token” in the pop-upped web browser.\nWe can think of GitHub’s personal access token as a password that expires. You can decide how long it remains valid. My recommendation is to set its expiration for May 31, 2025, or later.\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, copy the generated PAT, and paste it to your clipboard or R script.\n\n\nStep 5. Set the GitHub credential using the PAT.\n\nIn RStudio Console, run the followings line by line:\n\ninstall.packages(\"gitcreds\")\ngitcreds::gitcreds_set()\n\nYou will be asked to provide your PAT.\nPaste your PAT to the RStudio Console, and then hit Enter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nIt does not harm to create multiple PAT for one GitHub account.\nAfter the PAT expires, you should repeat the following if you want to update your GitHub website:\n\n\nCreate a new PAT:\n\nusethis::create_github_token()\n\nReplace the current PAT with the new PAT:\n\ngitcreds::gitcreds_set()\n\nSelect the option 2: Replace these credentials by typing 2 and hitting Enter on R Console.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEstablishing the Connection between GitHub repo and your local Git\nStep 6. Login to your GitHib and make the repository.\n\nFrom https://github.com, click the plus [+] icon in the upper right corner and select “New repository”.\nName this repo USERNAME.github.io, which will be the domain for your website.\n\n\ne.g., If your GitHub username is abc9, the name of your repo should be abc9.github.io, not abc_9.github.io.\n\n\nThen, copy the web address of your GitHub repo, https://github.com/USERNAME/USERNAME.github.io\n\n\nFor example, the web address for Byeong-Hak’s GitHub repo is https://github.com/bcdanl/bcdanl.github.io.\n\n\nStep 7. Create a RStudio project with Version Control\n\n\n\n\nClick “Project (None)” at the top-right corner in RStudio.\nClick “New Project” &gt; “Version Control” &gt; “Git”\nPaste the web address of your GitHub repo to the Repository URL menu.\nClick “Browse” to select the parent directory for your local project directory (I recommend “Documents” folder.)\nClick “Create”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf Step 7 does not work on your laptop, try below Steps 7-1 and 7-2 instead. If Step 7 DOES work well, skip Steps 7-1 and 7-2.\n\n\nStep 7-1. Use git clone to establish the connection between GitHub repo and your local laptop:\n\nChange directory to “Documents” in Terminal using cd command.\n\ncd &lt;pathname of \"Documents\" directory&gt;\n\nHere, you need to know the pathname of “Documents” directory.\nFor example, LAPTOP_USERNAME below is not your GitHub username but one for your local laptop.\n\nMac\ncd /Users/LAPTOP_USERNAME/Documents\nWindows\ncd C:/Users/LAPTOP_USERNAME/Documents\n\nUse git clone to creates a local copy of the GitHub Repository.\n\ngit clone &lt;repository-url&gt;\n\nFor example,\n\ngit clone https://github.com/USERNAME/USERNAME.github.io\n\nStep 7-2. Create a RStudio project from Existing Directory\n\nClick “Project (None)” at the top-right corner in RStudio.\nClick “New Project” &gt; “Existing Directory”\nClick “Browse” to select the local copy of the GitHub Repository\nClick “Create Project”\n\n\n\n\nDownloading Website Template Files\nStep 8. Download the files of website template:\n\nGo to the following webpage: https://github.com/bcdanl/danl-website-template\nFrom the webpage above, click the green icon &lt; &gt; Code, and then click “Download Zip”\nExtract the Zip file you have downloaded\nIf there are the files, .gitignore, .DS_Store, or *.Rproj, in the folder, delete all of them.\nMove all the files that were compressed in the Zip file to your local project directory, USERNAME.github.io.\n\n\nSelect all the files in the danl-website-template folder (Tip: Ctrl + A (Windows) / command + A (Mac) selects all files in a directory).\nThen, Ctrl + C (Windows) / command + C (Mac) to copy them.\nThen, go to your local project directory USERNAME.github.io.\nThen, Ctrl + V (Windows) / command + V (Mac) to paste them to your local project directory USERNAME.github.io.\n\n\nRemove the danl-website-template directory from your local project directory, if you have one.\n\n\nAll the website files should be located at the same level with the R Project file (USERNAME.github.io.Rproj), shown below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPushing the Website Files to the GitHub repository\n\n\n\nStep 8. Push the files to your GitHub repository\n\nOn Terminal within RStudio, execute the following 3-step git commands, which will stage, commit, and push all the files in the local working directory to your GitHub repository:\n\n\ngit add . adds changes in your local working directory (e.g., edited files, new files, deleted files) to the staging area, which is a temporary area where you can prepare your next commit\n\ngit add .\n\ngit commit -m \"...\" records the changes in the staging area as a new snapshot in the local working directory, along with a message describing the changes.\n\ngit commit -m \"any message to describe the changes\"\n\ngit push uploads the local changes to the online repository in GitHub.\n\ngit push\n\nStep 9. Check whether the files are well uploaded.\n\nGo to the webpages of your GitHub repository and your website:\n\nhttps://github.com/USERNAME/USERNAME.github.io.git\nhttps://USERNAME.github.io\nRefresh the webpages (Ctrl + R for Windows users; cmd + R for Mac users)\n\nAdd a URL for your website (https://YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME.github.io/) in About section in your GihtHub repository webpage by clicking the setting.
